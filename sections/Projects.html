			<ul>
				<li>
					Developed an unsupervised approach to find the parameter setting with highest supervised measure score for the proposed Neighborhood and Community Aware Clustering method, and therefore created an automatic version of the proposed clustering method which can automatically choose an nearly optimal parameter setting.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Researched and experimented on the different preferences of different clustering criteria. Found the one most similar to the supervised B-cubed F1 measure and modified it to be an unsupervised graph based clustering criterion which is highly correlated with the B-cubed F1 measure on the clustering results obtained by our proposed clustering method.
				</li>
				<li>
					Work submitted to ECCV2018.

		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Designed a way to extract positive (same) and negative (different) relations between face tracks in the movie only based on the cuts and scene threads information. The result can help improve the performance of the movie face clustering algorithm.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Implemented a web based well designed labeling system. With the labeling system, me and Mingzhe labeled over 50 movies and 30000 face tracks. The results provided the necessary data to train our model
				</li>
				<li> 
					Researched and implemented several clustering algorithms such as Hierarchical cluster, Xmeans cluster and Kmeans cluster, with several cluster number determination method such as the Bayesian Information Criterion and Elbow method. Provided the baseline results on the movie face clustering problem.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Contributed to the design of the new proposed movie face clustering algorithm, including the feature selections and clustering scheme
