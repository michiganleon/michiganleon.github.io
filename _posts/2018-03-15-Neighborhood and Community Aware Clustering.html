		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developed an unsupervised approach to find the parameter setting with highest
			supervised measure score for the proposed Neighborhood and Community
			Aware Clustering method, and therefore created an automatic version of the
			proposed clustering method which can automatically choose an nearly optimal
			parameter setting.</li>
			<li>
			Researched and experimented on the different preferences of different clustering
			criteria. Found the one most similar to the supervised B-cubed F1 measure and
			modified it to be an unsupervised graph based clustering criterion which is highly
			correlated with the B-cubed F1 measure on the clustering results obtained by our
			proposed clustering method.</li>
